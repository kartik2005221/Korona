# Korona Game

Welcome to the Korona Game! This is a unique two-player psychological game that tests your strategic thinking and predictive abilities. It’s designed to challenge players to anticipate and understand each other's thought processes.
Overview

Korona is a game that revolves around the interaction between two roles: the Speaker and the Thinker. The objective for the Thinker is to predict what choice the Speaker will make from three options: Aroygya Setu, Aroygya Vati, and Aroygya Nothing. Each round provides an opportunity to test your predictive skills and deepen your understanding of your opponent's thought patterns.
How to Play

### Setup: 
Players choose their names and roles at the start of the game. By default, the Speaker is "Ram," and the Thinker is "Shyam."

### Game Flow:
The Speaker initiates the round by saying "Aroygya..." followed by a brief pause.
Both players then have five seconds to make their choice. The Thinker makes their selection privately, while the Speaker announces their choice openly.
Players make their selections using the keyboard: "1" for Aroygya Setu, "2" for Aroygya Vati, and "3" for Aroygya Nothing.
The round concludes with the Speaker's choice being revealed. If the Thinker successfully predicts this choice, roles are swapped; otherwise, the Speaker retains their role.

### Winning the Game: 
The game continues for a specified number of rounds or until a player reaches a certain score. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.
